# TicTacToe
Tic Tac Toe Game in java swing (first real project)

## Structure 
as my first program, the structure is only a procedural mess
I have some function who gouvern certain part of the game.
I code a little IA too, it's try to block the player from making a line of 3 or play at random

## Lesson Learned
Create a code that machine can ready is easy, create a code that humain car read and understand is way difficult.
I need a code structure, well named variable and a simple logic.
